Architecture
* Very controlled environment - each application component (App, Glance, Notification, Compliation) has base class and is very structured
* 3 Main components:
  * iOS Application
  * WatchOS Watch Application
    * Resources and Interface definition
  * WatchOS WatchKit Extension
    * Watch Application (Code)
    * Additional Resources
* 4 roles in watchkit architecture (each with base classes)
  * Application
  * Glance
  * notification
  * Complication - see separate session on complications (link TODO)
* Resources need to be in the right place for the right purpose - e.g. images in application bundle can be used to link to interface outlets but those in extension bundle cannot - but can be accessed via code.
* Data Storage Folders
  * Document Directory - more permanent
  * Cache Directory - temporary storage
* Media
  *
